Scoping
  - Where we can access a certain variable
  - Each new function creates a scope: the space/ environment in which the variables it defines are accessible
  - The only way to create a new scope is to write a new function
Lexical Scoping
  - Function that is lexically within another function gets access to the scope of the outer function ðŸ’«
